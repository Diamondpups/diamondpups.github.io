  <h1 class="title uppercase" id="article-title">Who is the Mothman?</h1>
  <p>The mothman is a squishy boi who likes l√§mps, eating soul pancakes, and devouring the souls of those who see him. He is very shy, and does not like human companions(with the exclusion of Akira "Keith" Kogane)</p>
  <h2>Friends</h2>
  <p>While Mothman may not particularly favor humans, he does have many cryptid frens. Some of these include but are not limited to: Nightcrawlers, Reptilians, Goatman, and Loveland Frogmen. Most of these friends live in North America, and slay all day together frequently. However, some of Mothman's frens live far away so they only get to hit the nip together a couple times a year</p>
